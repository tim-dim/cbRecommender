# Content-based Recommender
Result of the exercise is a functional content-based recommender for movie recommendations. K-Means clustering is used to suggest new movies to a user, based on ratings of movies the user already watched.

The reason I was keen on posting these is because with relatively little knowledge of programming you can access tremendously power techniques in R. I hope that anyone who stumbles upon these exercises can benefit from seeing R in action.

Please feel free to shoot over any comments or suggestions to improve these exercises!
